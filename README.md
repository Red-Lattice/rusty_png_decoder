# Rusty PNG Decoder
This decodes a spore creation PNG into the raw xml that is read in game.
# Why?
The only existing png decoders are in python and C#, both managed languages. I wanted a low level version so it could be used in many different places theoretically. As well I felt I could clean up the code a bit.
# TODO
Adventures have extra steps applied to read from those. I want to try and implement that functionality at some point.
